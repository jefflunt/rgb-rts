RGB Real-Time Strategy Game
- BUG: input handling clicking - it's passing events to all stacked units, but we need a way to
  only get the click event to the unit on top
- FEATURE: control groups:
  - click+drag to select units in a rectangle
  - take the list of selected units and store it in a "selected units" array
  - allow things like Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. to assigne the "selected units" into a control group
- gold mines should have a limit
